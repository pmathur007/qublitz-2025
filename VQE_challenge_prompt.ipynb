    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, the field of computational chemistry has had massive success. However, as progress in computational chemistry accelerates, the nascent field's demand for computational resources has increased exponentially. The emerging field of computational quantum chemistry was established to help bridge the gap between the demand and availability of computational power for computational chemistry-related simulations, aiming to exploit quantum entanglement and other quantum phenomena through quantum computing to simulate the quantum mechanics of chemical systems more accurately and rapidly than what is currently possible with classical simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A promising application of quantum computing to open problems in computational chemistry lies in finding the possible electronic configurations for a given molecule. You may remember from introductory chemistry that the nuclei of atoms are usually surrounded by regions of space, known as orbitals, which contain the atom's electrons. According to Molecular Orbital (MO) Theory, when atoms combine to form molecules, the atomic orbitals of each constituent atom combine and interact with the atomic orbitals of other atoms in the molecule to form molecular orbitals, so the electronic configuration of the molecule is different than the sum of the electronic configurations of each constituent atom. Thankfully, the laws of quantum mechanics constrain the number of probable and stable electronic configurations a given molecule can have, and computational approaches, both classical and quantum, have been devised to help solve for the possible electronic configurations for molecules of various sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "An electronic configuration of special interest is the lowest energy, or \"ground state\" electron configuration. In this challenge, you and your team will create a hybrid algorithm with both classical and quantum elements that can take information about a molecule's energy in the form of a Hamiltonian and use it to find the ground state energy level of the molecule."

    "## Challenge Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "For molecules, the electronic structure of a given molecule can be completely described by specifying its Hamiltonian $H$, a matrix (more generally, an operator) that completely specifies how the energy of the molecule evolves over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chemists represent the molecular Hamiltonian in terms of quantum field theory (QFT) operators that operate directly on the electrons (a type of fermion), and a Hamiltonian of this form, known as a fermionic Hamiltonian, cannot be directly used as input for a quantum computer since it directly operates on electrons instead of the qubits. Thus, it is necessary to map the QFT operators to quantum gates, converting the fermionic Hamiltonian into a qubit (or spin) Hamiltonian that can operate on qubits on a quantum computer. The first part of the challenge will involve implementing the Jordan-Wigner Transform to map an arbitrary fermionic Hamiltonian to a qubit Hamiltonian.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the spin Hamiltonian for a molecule, the ground state energy of the molecule is given by the smallest eigenvector of the spin Hamiltonian matrix. To find this eigenvalue, we will construct a high-level implementation of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver, a hybrid quantum and classical optimization algorithm that, in particular, can find eigenvalues of a given matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the last part of the challenge involves optimizing your JWT and VQE algorithms to use fewer qubits and run more effectively."

    "For the sake of completeness, the following section is included to provide an introduction to the structure of the fermionic Hamiltonian and does not need to be understood fully. To conveniently specify states with multiple particles, we will use the occupation number representation. Let $\\{|1\\rangle, |2\\rangle,...\\}$ be a set of single-particle states that form an orthonormal basis for the single-particle Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}^{(1)}$, and let $n_j$ particles be in state $|j\\rangle$. Then, we can represent a multi-particle state by\n",

    "\n",
    "$$S = \\{|n_1, n_2,... \\rangle : j \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 1}, n_j \\in \\{0, 1\\}\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "forms a complete orthogonal basis for the vector space consisting of the fermion multi-particle quantum states (i.e. multi-particle states that are antisymmetric under exchange). More specifically, $S$ forms a complete orthogonal basis for the fermionic Fock space\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{F}_A = \\mathcal{H}^{(0)} \\oplus \\mathcal{H}^{(1)} \\oplus \\mathcal{H}^{(2)}_A \\oplus \\mathcal{H}^{(3)}_A \\oplus...$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\oplus$ is a direct sum and $\\mathcal{H}^{(j)}_A$ is the antisymmetric subspace of the $j$-particle Hilbert space. Thus, any physical state of fermions $| \\Psi \\rangle$ can be written in the form\n",

    "\n",
    "We now use the occupation number representation to introduce a formalism for constructing and describing fermionic Hamiltonians, known as the second quantization formalism. A fermionic Hamiltonian is described by a system of $N$ fermionic modes (in our case, this corresponds to a system with $N$ fermions). Each fermionic mode is given by the set of annihilation operators $\\{\\hat{a}_1, ..., \\hat{a}_{N-1}\\}$. The adjoint $\\hat{a}_j^\\dagger$ of an annihilation operator $\\hat{a}_j$ is known as a creation operator, and the creation and annihilation operators are collectively referred to as fermionic ladder operators. While fully understanding creation and annihilation operators would require quantum field theory, we can try to understand them by considering how they would act on a multi-particle quantum state. On an arbitrary multi-particle quantum state, the action of the fermionic creation and annihilation operators is given by\n",

    "\n",
    "where $\\delta_{\\mu, \\nu}$ is the Kronecker delta function and $\\gamma = e^{i\\pi \\sum_{k < j} n_k}$ is an unimportant phase factor. Thus, on the vacuum state $|\\varnothing \\rangle = |00...0 \\rangle$ corresponding to no fermions present,\n",

To simulate fermions on a quantum computer, we must first find a good representation of the creation and annihilation operators on the Hilbert space of qubits so that we can map the fermionic Hamiltonian to a qubit Hamiltonian.
